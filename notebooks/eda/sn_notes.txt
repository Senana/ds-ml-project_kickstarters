============== Plan 
We are going to predict Kickstarter Projects failing or being successful
- since most projects failed, unbalanced dataset - remember that in the measures to. choose 

- if the question is "what are the chances of my kickstarter project to be successful" 
I don't know the backers at the outset 

--- but we have time - so we can work with "lifetime values" 
--- but we don't know how many backers the projects HAD at what point, unfortunately
--- so "accelleration" is not in the data 

> Backers correlate heavily with success 
--- which categories attract how many backers? 
--- money-per-backer is something we could work with, but it's going to be wrong because all we can do is the average ... unfortunately


> Backers and countries could also be correlated
> Categories and backers could correlate? 

then: money with money. How much "more" did you make than your goal? (how much less?)


==== ToDo 

Let's drop: Name, Category, Goal, pledged, Currency, USD pledged (remains: goal_real, main_category, usd_pledged_real)
--- paranoia check: you could quickly go into success measures by category if wanted 

Let's keep "failed" and "successful" 
- we can try with "cancelled" and without (if we have resources)
- the "other" states let's just drop 

Let's transform: Dates into Datetime (granularity to get amount of days)
* calculate a new column "duration" by deadline - launched 

We need outlier cleaning 
- check for unrealistic durations and cut somewhere 
- money: let's make a decision about money in the "failed" category (unrealistically high umber)
- question: we want the big numbers in there, they are "real" outliers mostly 
- we can circumvent some problemy by binning (same for pledged and goal)
--- let's try 6 bins 
(Optional): we could check in with the old dataframe and see if the same outliers appear

Backers: 
- let's go for "backer by country"
- "backer by category"
- ratio backers / money pledged 

When we're done, we will need to scale (or dummy) - let's make several versions of the data 

Countries: 
- Let's go for continents then (Leya's version)


================ ToDo for the feature engineering
I want to check certain rates for both winners and losers 
to look for useful metrics that are informative to the algorithm:

Further cleaning 

BACKERS
* we can't really use backers 
--- they won't be there at the moment we are looking at a new campaign! 
--- in a real business environment you wouldn't use those to predict in real
* worth trying, a running ratio would be available in real time 
TODO: calculate a sensible ratio and check if it works out 
* we could use backers as a baseline? 

CATEGORIES 


TIME 
* we only have very little temporal info:
* Best Season / best Month to start a campaign 
TODO: make "month of launch" category 
TODO: make a "month of deadline" category 
TODO: make "duration" categories 


--- maybe: explode polynomial features: 
* month and goal? 
* Category and goal? 

CATEGORY
==> RL reason: 100k in tech is not the same as 100k in poetry 
TODO: make a good combination measure "goal per category"
--- for that: also try for four bins of "goal size" (after throwing out "small fish" and "unicorns")

==> Category per continent makes sense. 
Hypothesis: Certain topics ("tech in US") are more successful coming from certain countries or continents
TODO: make a "category per continent" polynomial 

==> launched and deadline are available 
- sames for money, it's probably realistic per category (idea)
TODO: Once we have duration bins, make category-bin duration-bin polynomial 

TEXT 
* sentiment / keyword analysis for the title 
==> biggest RL argument to go for this one! BUT we lack the 
--- postponed. (sentiment analysis...)
--- we COULD do a "buzzword analysis" per category using wordcloud algorithms 
TODO: include on slide and if we have looooooots of time get to it 

* backers over time (duration)
* backers ratio to both goal and pledged 
* size bin distribution 
--- if we do quantiles it'll distribute the values, but it'll show differently with winners or losers. 
--- so do we do quantiles overall? - that's the question isn't it. 
* That is - sensible units for the goal and pledged distributions (winners, losers, overall?)

Money measures: 
* ratio pledged / goal could be interesting 

Potential measures: 
* distance from median per project? 
---- hypothesis: above-median proportionally increases success (for backers, pledged)

Question: 
* What do we do with backers vs. pledged: leave one out, take a composite measure, keep both but bin? 


-----------------Outlier cleaning
* I would opt for taking out the "big hitters" and noting that we did so (see distribution curves)

Question: 
* We could do something like cutting the "didn't get off the ground" (lower end) which would actually balance our dataset more 


-----------------Feature engineering

Categoricals: 
* There's different effects on different algorithms for different choices 
--- get dummies
--- keep scales which are within the same range 
--- keep numeric but scale

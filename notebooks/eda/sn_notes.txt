============== Plan 
We are going to predict Kickstarter Projects failing or being successful
- since most projects failed, unbalanced dataset - remember that in the measures to. choose 

- if the question is "what are the chances of my kickstarter project to be successful" 
I don't know the backers at the outset 

--- but we have time - so we can work with "lifetime values" 
--- but we don't know how many backers the projects HAD at what point, unfortunately
--- so "accelleration" is not in the data 

> Backers correlate heavily with success 
--- which categories attract how many backers? 
--- money-per-backer is something we could work with, but it's going to be wrong because all we can do is the average ... unfortunately


> Backers and countries could also be correlated
> Categories and backers could correlate? 

then: money with money. How much "more" did you make than your goal? (how much less?)


==== ToDo 

Let's drop: Name, Category, Goal, pledged, Currency, USD pledged (remains: goal_real, main_category, usd_pledged_real)
--- paranoia check: you could quickly go into success measures by category if wanted 

Let's keep "failed" and "successful" 
- we can try with "cancelled" and without (if we have resources)
- the "other" states let's just drop 

Let's transform: Dates into Datetime (granularity to get amount of days)
* calculate a new column "duration" by deadline - launched 

We need outlier cleaning 
- check for unrealistic durations and cut somewhere 
- money: let's make a decision about money in the "failed" category (unrealistically high umber)
- question: we want the big numbers in there, they are "real" outliers mostly 
- we can circumvent some problemy by binning (same for pledged and goal)
--- let's try 6 bins 
(Optional): we could check in with the old dataframe and see if the same outliers appear

Backers: 
- let's go for "backer by country"
- "backer by category"
- ratio backers / money pledged 

When we're done, we will need to scale (or dummy) - let's make several versions of the data 

Countries: 
- Let's go for continents then (Leya's version)
